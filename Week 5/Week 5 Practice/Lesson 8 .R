# A random sample of 1600 registered voters are contacted and asked 
# a variety of questions. For one question, 60% of the voters expressed 
# approval and 40% disapproval. Calculate a 95% confidence 
# interval for the proportion expressing approval.

#Here we will use a built-in R function for testing a proportion.
#prop.test(x, n, p = NULL,

# x a vector of counts of successes, a one-dimensional table with two entries,
#   or a two-dimensional table (or matrix) with 2 columns, giving the counts of
#   successes and failures, respectively.
# n a vector of counts of trials; ignored if x is a matrix or a table.

# p a vector of probabilities of success. The length of p must be the same
#   as the number of groups specified by x, and its elements must be greater
#   than 0 and less than 1.
# alternative: a character string specifying the alternative hypothesis,
#   must be one of "two.sided" (default), "greater" or "less". You can specify
#   just the initial letter. Only used for testing the null that a single proportion
# equals a given value, or that two proportions are equal; ignored otherwise.
# conf.level: confidence level of the returned confidence interval.
#   Must be a single number between 0 and 1. Only used when testing the
#   null that a single proportion equals a given value, or that two proportions
#   are equal; ignored otherwise.
# correct: a logical indicating whether Yates' continuity correction should be
# applied where possible.

# A random sample of consumers are presented with two beverages 
# in random order and asked which they prefer most. All the consumers 
# expressed a preference. One beverage was preferred 85% of the time. 
# Use this number to determine how large a sample of consumers would 
# be needed to generate a 95% confidence interval with an overall width 
# just less than 2% (i.e. from 84% to 86%)?
